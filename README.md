# CSS Boilerplate

Some boilerplate for doing ITCSS (http://itcss.io/) with Sass. Work in progress.

`package.json` currently includes node modules this will depend on, will need to be added to your project idiomatically.

Will eventually add examples with Webpack etc.

Lots of this work has evolved from various projects, built on a lot from work by http://csswizardry.com/
